DNA Project Base
================

An extremely biased Yii-powered Project Base that allows rapid generation of deployable, testable and maintainable custom applications for enrichment and publishing of user-generated data, which in turn are made available for consumption by end user frontends through a RESTful API.

It's main focus is to enable automation in as many aspects of the development process as viable, so that the developers' energy is focused on custom business logic (the "DNA").

NOTE: This project is in it's earliest stages and will be updated as it's progressing.

Feel free to read this readme and supply early feedback through Github issues.

## The DNA Project Base Project Goals

DNA Project Base will assist in:
* Providing a useful Content and User Management UI with publishing/authoring workflows
* Providing a useful RESTful API (for end user frontends and machine-machine communication)
* Properly adapting to changes in the databases, metadata and configuration
* Pre-release testing of the above applications
* Deploying the above applications (to a Heroku-buildpack-based PaaS provider)
