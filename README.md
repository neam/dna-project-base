Yii DNA
============

Yii Project Base that allows rapid generation of deployable, testable and maintainable custom Yii applications that assist in publishing meaningful content consumed by end user frontends through a RESTful API.

NOTE: This project is in it's earliest stages and will be updated as it's progressing.

Feel free to read this readme and supply early feedback through Github issues.

## The Yii DNA Project Goals

Yii DNA will assist in:
* Providing a useful Content and User Management UI with publishing/authoring workflows
* Providing a useful RESTful API (for end user frontends and machine-machine communication)
* Quickly adapting to changes in the databases, metadata and configuration
* Pre-release testing of the above applications
* Deploying the above applications (to a Heroku-buildpack-based PaaS provider)
